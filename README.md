_**THIS REPO'S CONTENT IS CURRENTLY UNDER CONSTRUCTION**_

This is a repo for my EntreFEST 2019 talk Machine Learning: Zero to Up and Running. It contains setup instructions and code so that you can run your first Machine Learning model. Let's get started!

You'll need to do a little setup before you can run the code in this repo:
* Download and install the latest Anaconda distribution from https://www.anaconda.com/distribution
* Use your favorite git client to clone this repository to you computer. If you don't have a favorite, try https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/
* Open the Anaconda prompt
* Change directories to the location where you cloned this repo
* Create a new Anaconda environment by running `conda create -n entrefest_2019 python=3.7 anaconda=2018.12`
* Activate the envrionment you just created by running `conda activate entrefest_2019`
* Finally, run `jupyter notebook` to bring up the Jupyter Notebook interface in your browser. From here you can interactively run each step in building your first Machine Learning model.
